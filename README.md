# Crop & Soil Health Report

## Overview
The Crop & Soil Health Report project is designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions about crop cultivation. The program takes in user inputs such as region, month of growing, last crop grown, soil deficits, and additional information to generate a comprehensive report. The report includes weather patterns, rainfall expectations, soil rejuvenation methods, and recommendations for promising crops to grow based on the input data.

## Features
- **User Input**: Collects detailed information from the user including:
  - Region
  - Month of growing
  - Last crop grown
  - Soil deficits and excesses
  - Additional information (e.g., soil compaction)
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes the input data to determine:
  - Weather patterns
  - Rainfall expectations
  - Soil health status
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights on:
  - Soil rejuvenation methods
  - Suitable crops for the upcoming season

## Example

### Input
```plaintext
I'm planning to grow crops in Punjab, India, this July. The soil in my area is quite alkaline, with a pH level of 8.3. The last crop grown here was wheat. I've noticed some nutrient deficiencies, especially in nitrogen and potassium. There are also areas where the soil seems compacted.

Final Crop Health Report

Crop Health Summary for Punjab in July

Rainfall Expectations:
In Punjab, rainfall during July is expected to be from 38.43 millimeters (1.51 inches) to 8.3 inches. Adequate rainfall is crucial for crop growth, while excessive or insufficient rainfall can be detrimental.

Weather Patterns:
The weather patterns in Punjab for July indicate very warm temperatures, with precipitation levels ranging from high to heavy. Typical weather conditions include average temperatures around 29.6° C (85.3° F), which play a critical role in crop growth.

Soil Health Analysis:
The soil in Punjab has been assessed for various health indicators. Currently, the soil nature is alkaline with a pH level of 8.3. Soil health shows nutrient deficits, especially in nitrogen and potassium. Additionally, there is a possibility of high sodium levels or imbalances in boron, copper, iron, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. Soil seems compacted in some areas, indicating a need for specific nutrient supplementation and soil rejuvenation methods.

Soil Rejuvenation Methods:
To improve soil health and ensure a conducive environment for crop growth, the following rejuvenation methods are recommended:
1. Apply fertilizers rich in nitrogen and potassium to address the deficits.
2. Considering the high pH level (8.3), applying gypsum or elemental sulfur can help lower the pH.
3. Adopt crop rotation methods to improve soil health.
4. Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and nutrient content.

Additional Information:
The soil in central Punjab ranges from sandy loam to clayey with pH value from 7.8 to 8.5, making alkalinity and salinity problematic for this place. Suitable crops to grow in these conditions might include cotton, pearl millet, black gram, green gram, or sesame.

Recommended Crops for the Upcoming Season:
Based on the analysis of soil and weather conditions, the following crops are recommended for cultivation: cotton, pearl millet, black gram, green gram, or sesame. These crops are chosen for their suitability to the current soil health, expected rainfall, and typical weather patterns in the region.

This report provides actionable insights into soil and environmental conditions, helping stakeholders make informed decisions for successful crop cultivation in Punjab during July.
